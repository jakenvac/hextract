###Usage
Drag a text based document *(.txt, .html, .xml, .xaml etc.)* that contains hexacdecimal colour codes onto the main window area and the application will generate a listview of all of the coulours present in the document.

To export the extracted colours, click on the export icon in the top right of the application. This will save a text file with a list of all hex colours in the application.

To clear the list, simply hit the clear list icon.
